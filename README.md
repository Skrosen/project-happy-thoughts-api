# Project Happy Thoughts API

Created an API for existing frontend and replaced the old urls in the frontend
project with this api. The api shows the last 20 posts to the database and keeps
and shows count on the amount of likes on each post.

## The problem

For this project I used mongoose schema and model, mongo operator to increase
the likes on click and give back the latest count to the user directly.
